# Fruit Ninja iOS
Not to be mistaken with the well-known Fruit Ninja game on the App Store, this is an iOS adaptation of our [Real Time 3D Graphics Game, Fruit Ninja,](https://github.com/hungrylittlebear/FruitNinja) created overnight for a hackathon.

## Gameplay

## Inspiration

Participated in a game development one day hackathon and I thought it would be fun to bring our beloved Desktop game Fruit Ninja to iOS!

Recreated a few similar level experiences from the Desktop version as well as added some fun new puzzles to solve.
